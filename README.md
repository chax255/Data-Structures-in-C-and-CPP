In this README we are going to write notes about the C language and example code, but the goal is to write algorithms using the C and CPP languages. Mind that I am not a complete beginner in C but I am a beginner in CPP hence alot of mistakes should be expected but I will recover them as time goes by and hope this will be a great learning experience. Follow example C/CPP  beginning code  in the CPrimer.c file more files will be generated with time. Including the  algorithm related onces. 

C was created by Dennis Ritchie in 1972, at Bell Labs. I was used to create the Unix Operating system together with Ken Thompson and from this invention both Ken and Dennis received the Turing award.

C was a system implementation language before it became a general purpose programming language it was used to replace languages like B and algo
